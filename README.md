# AI-Driven HPLC and GLPC Testing for Agrochemicals

## Overview
This project leverages AI to enhance High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Gas-Liquid Chromatography (GLPC) testing in agrochemicals. It provides an interactive interface for users to analyze, compare, and optimize chemical formulations for improved efficiency and compliance.

## Features
- **Chemical Selection**: Dropdown list of commonly used agrochemicals with the ability to add/remove entries.
- **Formulation Input**: Users can enter the percentage composition of the formulation.
- **HPLC/GLPC Data Analysis**: Compare actual vs. desired results with visualization.
- **Undo Feature**: Allows reverting the last action for better usability.
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, update, and delete chemicals in the system dynamically.

## Installation
